# FlatMap CompactMap Map in swift

#Map 
- Map tranform an array of values into an array of another values
- Map return in form of array of array ( for e.g [[String]])

#FlatMap
- Map make the things complicated while accessing so we used FlatMap
- FlatMap is similary to Map but it's flatten a result of nested collections into single collection

#CompactMap
- Map & Flat Map don't handle the nil error so we used compactMap to handle that
